# BedrockTweaker
BedrockTweaker is currently unfinished! There is a known issue where PocketMine interferes with the bedrock file making it so the bedrock reappears right after being broken (Any ideas or fixes can be left in the Issues tab). This plugin is still being developed and will be until the issue is fixed. Below is some other information including the Commands for the plugin and changelog.
